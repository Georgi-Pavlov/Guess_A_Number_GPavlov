"Guess a number" is a simple game where you try to guess the number, that your opponent (computer) has come up with.
The number is being randomly selected between 1 and 100.

You are prompted to enter your guess and will receive a hit "Your number is too high!" or "Your number is too low!" to try and help you guess it.

If you enter not a valid number, you will get a message and prompt to try again: "This is not a valid number! Try again..."

You win when your number matches the number choosen by the computer and you will see the message "Congratulations, you guess it!"
