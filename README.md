About the Game:

Guess a Number is a classic game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess it.

After each guess, the game will tell you whether your number is:
- too high,
- too low,
or exactly right (congratulations, human...I mean player)

Features:
- Random number generation
- Input validation with error handling
- Helpful (and slightly sarcastic) feedback messages

How to Run:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/GPavlov/Guess_A_Number_GPavlov.git
Run the script:
python guess_number.py

Example Output:

Future Improvements:

- Add difficulty levels
- Count the number of attempts
- Add a replay option
- Turn it into a GUI version (eventually)
